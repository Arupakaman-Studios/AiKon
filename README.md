Test and preview your android app icons with AiKon. AiKon lets you make a home screen shortcut to help you in previewing your icon.

With AiKon you can also check how your icon looks in the notification bar and service.

The process of icon designing usually takes place on a desktop computer. On desktop it can be hard to recreate the perspective as well as the contrast of mobile phone. This is where AiKon steps in. Without the hassle of building an apk, you can easily test the designed icon.

With Notification icons, we face the same problems. Sometimes it is based on stroke size or just perspective difference. AiKon also generates notification previews for you application icons.

In fact, AiKon was made for testing icons of applications made by arupakaman studios. We find AiKon to be a really helpful tool for both UI/UX Designers as well as Application Developers.
